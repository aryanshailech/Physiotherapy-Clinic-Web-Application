        <p>Physiotherapy is generally described as a treatment method commonly used in preventing injury, promoting health, and maximizing physical strength. However, when you take a closer look, you’ll notice that it’s actually a kind of umbrella term under which physical therapy practices and treatments fall. Below, we explore the common types of physiotherapy and the conditions they treat.</p>

                <h3>Sports Physiotherapy</h3>

Sports physiotherapists specialize in diagnosing and treating sports-related injuries, and they can help you recover faster from a sports injury and boost your overall performance.</p>
                <p>Our sports physiotherapy services include personalized exercise programs, manual therapy, and injury prevention strategies to keep you at your best. Whether you're recovering from an injury or looking to enhance your performance, our experts are here to help.</p>
